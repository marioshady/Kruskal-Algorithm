# Kruskal-Algorithm
Kruskal's algorithm finds a minimum spanning forest of an undirected edge-weighted graph. If the graph is connected, it finds a minimum spanning tree. It is a greedy algorithm in graph theory as in each step it adds the next lowest-weight edge that will not form a cycle to the minimum spanning forest.

I implemented the project for a company that has branches in different cities, and want to connect them all to each other, with cutting the expenses by limitting the distance travelled.
